# Evanescent

Evanescent was created by four developers, which is a marketplace designed for the creator who chooses to produce small-batch / one-of-a-kind pieces that may only be produced on a limited basis, and for the patron who is looking for a rare item that very few others may be able to procure. This will create interest for buyers by making them realize that they will not be able to get certain items if they miss the sale window.
